# MedKG - Medical knowledge graph

In this repo, we will build out a system for indexing knowledge contained within unstructured medical research.

To do this, we will maintain a list of core entities, attributes for each entity, relationships between these entities and attributes for these relationships. 

We also provide an AI chat agent augmented with tools that can access this knowledge. 

## TODO

- Data models
    - Core entities
    - Attributes for each entity
    - Relationships between entities
    - Attributes for each relationship

- Extraction script
    - Input unstructured text
    - Output:
        - Core entities
        - Attributes for each entity
        - Relationships between entities
        - Attributes for each relationship

- Chat agent


## Open Questions

- Do we need a different set of entities for different branches of science?
- What tools are relevant for the chat agent?
