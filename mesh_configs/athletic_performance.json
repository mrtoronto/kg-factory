For each entity, capture relevant properties like Name, Description, Value, and Measurement Unit. Look for relationships between entities, such as how Training Programs influence Performance Metrics or how Physiological Parameters affect an Athlete's performance. Pay attention to specific aspects such as environmental conditions, nutritional factors, psychological influences, and injuries related to performance. Also, note any measurements taken, their units, and any temporal information provided (e.g., when measurements were taken or the duration of training).",
